ABSTRACT:
Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient prognosis
and long-term survival rates. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based
approach for automatic lung cancer detection using histopathology images and
the GoogLeNet algorithm. Histopathology images provide valuable microscopic
information about lung tissue, allowing for detailed analysis of cellular and 
tissue structures. GoogLeNet, a powerful variant of convolutional neural net
works (CNNs), is well-suited for image classification tasks and has shown 
promising results in medical image analysis. By leveraging its deep archi
tecture and hierarchical feature extraction capabilities, we aim to accurately
classify lung cancer histopathology images. Our dataset consists of a large
collection of labeled histopathology slides, encompassing a diverse range of
lung cancer subtypes and stages. We will meticulously train and evaluate our
model using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Furthermore, we will compare the performance of GoogLeNet with other state
of-the-art CNN architectures in the domain of histopathology image analysis.
This project demonstrates the potential of applying deep learning techniques
to histopathology images for early and accurate lung cancer detection, 
contributing to more effective diagnostic tools in clinical practice.
